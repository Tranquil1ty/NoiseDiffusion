# NOISEDIFFUSION:CORRECTING NOISE FOR IMAGE INTERPOLATION WITH DIFFUSION MODELS BEYOND SPHERICAL LINEAR INTERPOLATION

[Paper]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12560](https://openreview.net/forum?id=6O3Q6AFUTu&referrer=%5Bthe%20profile%20of%20PengFei%20Zheng%5D(%2Fprofile%3Fid%3D~PengFei_Zheng2)))

Fork of [ControlNet](https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) adapted for generating videos that interpolate between two arbitrary given images, as described in ["Interpolating between Images with Diffusion Models"](https://clintonjwang.github.io/interpolation). See installation instructions in the original ControlNet repository.
